# Getting started with districity
Using districity is fairly easy. To start off, grab a copy of it from
[here](https://github.com/xTrayambak/districity). \

You'll need a working Nim toolchain to compile districity. This means, Nim and Nimble. \
After you have that, compile districity like this:
```sh
$ nimble build -d:release
```
A new binary will appear in your working directory. Now, copy it to a suitable location, and run the following:
```sh
$ ./districity create my_pc_setup
```
The name of the project can be anything, not necessarily "my_pc_setup". \
After that, do as it says, and you should have a basic districity project set up.
